#
# This is an example of configuration file, wherein global paths and parameters
# related to the analysis of receiver functions are defined. At least one file 
# should reside in the folder in which you intend to run your scripts. 
# The configuration file(s) can have any name, as long as the extension is 'cnf':
# e.g., 'RF_analysis.cnf', 'RF_config.cnf', 'myconfig.cnf', 'test.cnf'...
#
# The parameters are divided in several sections:
# - [paths]                : default paths to input/output folders
# - [quality]              : parameters to control receiver functions quality
# - [plot]                 : parameters to plot receiver functions
#
# Before using the scripts, you should at least make sure that the paths in 
# section [paths] are consistent with your own files and folders organization.
