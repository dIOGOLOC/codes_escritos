This project is dedicated to provide a Python framework for analysing the quality of
seismological data based on [ObsPy](https://github.com/obspy/obspy/wiki)

Requirements
------------
The code is developped on Ubuntu with Python Python 3.6.

In addition to [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-365/), you need
to use (sometimes install) the following packages:

- [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [ObsPy](https://github.com/obspy/obspy/wiki)
- [json](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html)
- [os](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html)

How to update
-------------
The code is still experimental so you should regularly check for (and pull) 
updates.
