#
# This is an example of configuration file, wherein global paths and parameters
# related to the analysis of quality of seismological data are defined. At least 
# one file should reside in the folder in which you intend to run your scripts. 
# The configuration file(s) can have any name, as long as the extension is 'cnf':
# e.g., 'analysis.cnf', 'caninana_config.cnf', 'myconfig.cnf', 'test.cnf'...
#
# The parameters are divided in several sections:
# - [PATH]                : default paths to input/output folders
# - [XML]                 : parameters to create xml file
#
# Before using the scripts, you should at least make sure that the paths in 
# section [PATH] are consistent with your own files and folders organization.
